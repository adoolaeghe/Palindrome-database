# Palindrome-database
### Description
A palindrome is a word or phrase string that reads the same backwards as forwards, independent of spaces and punctuation. An example could be 'Mr Own ate my metal worm'.

The application has a simple REST interface that presents two endpoints:
* An endpoint that accepts a string parameter, that will return true if the string is palindrome (and false otherwise)

* An endpoint that returns a list of the last 10 palindromes the system has received in the last 10 minutes.
